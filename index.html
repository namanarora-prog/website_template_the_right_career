                                    technician, bariatric surgeon, laparoscopic surgeon amongst many others.

                                                        career decisions.
                                                        Broadly, there are two prominent trends as to how students

                                                                chosen

                                                            <li>They choose what’s popular and what their friends

                                                        </ol>
                                                        Both of these approaches raise more questions than they

                                                        critical elements which influence career decisions in big
                                                        ways.
                                                        The underlying process in career assessments, is quite
                                                        simple actually. Career assessments lay down all the
                                                        possible elements one needs to consider to make a career
                                                        decision, in front of students, who are now required to
                                                        select a response that most resonates with them.
                                                        Thus, a student keeps streamlining towards their best-fit
                                                        career, with the progression of the assessment, essentially
